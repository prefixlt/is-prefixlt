Dear Professor,
As I mentioned on Monday, I didn't figure out a specific topic to do. However, I think now there's a plan in my mind.
When I heard Xiao said he's going to detect bots in social media, I remember that there're some famous things become famous because someone made it famous. I mean, China has a tool called Weibo which similar to Twitter+Facebook, and almost every teenager use it. Sometimes, a topic or a movie becomes extremely popular, and everyone on Weibo is "re-tweeting" it or commits it. But I know, that's a trick made by some companies. Some companies will hire users or use bots to spread messages about the staff they want to make it hot.
I believe Xiao can share some information about detecting bots. But my main work is going to be detecting human users' abnormal interests. For instance, I'm a huge fan of video games, so I will only focus on this area's information. What if I suddenly switch my interest into a recent published book? Well, if that's the only condition, then the accuracy may be poor. But I believe there's more information I can dig out.

Is that's a proper topic for the future research?

Regards,
Yiming
