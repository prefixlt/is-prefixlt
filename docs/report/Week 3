There're some famous things become famous because someone made it famous. I mean, China has a tool called Weibo which similar to Twitter+Facebook, and almost every teenager use it. Sometimes, a topic or a movie becomes extremely popular, and everyone on Weibo is "re-tweeting" it or commits it. But I know, that's a trick made by some companies. Some companies will hire users or use bots to spread messages about the staff they want to make it hot.
My main work is going to be detecting human users' abnormal interests. For instance, I'm a huge fan of video games, so I will only focus on this area's information. What if I suddenly switch my interest into a recent published book? Well, if that's the only condition, then the accuracy may be poor. But I believe there's more information I can dig out.
