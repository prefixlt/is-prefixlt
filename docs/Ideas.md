Here are three (fictitional!) project ideas:

1. **Lotto Predictor**: I will design an algorithm to predict the winning lotto numbers based on the most popular numbers on Twitter. To do so, I will use the Twitter Streaming API to collect a sample of messages for each week, then count the frequency of each number. I will then guess the week's winning lotto numbers by combining the most popular numbers. I will evaluate over 10 weeks and report accuracy and total earnings.
2. I'm interested in the machine learning theory, such as the application made by Microsoft called Adam, or Google Brain. I know it may be hard to accomplish the research in 1 semester, but I still have great passion on it...
3. I've taken the data mining course this semester, so perhaps keep doing the data mining research in the following semester will be a good choice. I read through your website and found that you are good at social media mining area. If possible, I'd like to follow your step and learn your best research direction!
