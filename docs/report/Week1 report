I've done this week's reading assignment, and the report has been attached. Please check it out.
If you don't mind, I'd like to summarize some of my thoughts after reading these articles at here.
1. About deep learning: It's a really interesting topic, and I saw lots of researches on that. 
  However, there's always a trade-off due to the present technology restriction, which is the immense computer power and the availability of massive training datasets. 
  Bigger training datasets may increase the accuracy, but cost too much on training time. 
  So most of the papers, as far as I see, focus on some unique methods/techniques to balance the trade-off.
2. About the social media, ton of the articles focus on FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram. 
  It's reasonable, since these three companies did incredible jobs. 
  Researchers using data mining techniques to find interesting points among the datasets (like the information credibility on Twitter).
3. To be honest, I did a poor job on Analyze Data/Method which you asked for. 
  Because most of the articles are too hard for me to understand right now. 
  I know the further job is learning these things and I will try to learn these "fancy" techniques in my spare time. 
  So, please forgive me if you don't like my analysis on this part...

p.s. All the papers are found in ACM Digital Library, and I've attached them in case you want to have a look at it~

Alright, that's all my words.
Thank you for reading it!
