During the last week, I tried to find some clues to support my idea. I didn't find convincing clues on Twitter; I think one possible reason is that I'm not that familiar with the social media topic trends in America. But I'm familiar with the Chinese version Twitter, which called Weibo. And I found some hyped events with no doubt.
There's an annual television event on March 15th every year. The purpose of this event is to uncover the cheating activities made by any kind of companies.
On March, 15th, 2012, this  TV show uncovered the cheating activity made by Apple. According to their words, Apple company was using the dual standards. For example, in the United States, Apple repair the iPhone by changing into a brand new device. However, in China, Apple actual repair the products without changing the frame or other parts. Consequently, the customs service in China was in an obvious low level.
Just let you know, this TV show was held by CCTV. It's the official TV channel held by Chinese government. So it means we could believe their words.
The interesting things happened right after that TV show. Some celebrities used their personal Weibo accounts and posted some words to support CCTV. Their words were almost the same. At least, in the very similar pattern. But the ridiculous thing was, one celebrity posted his words in such a pattern:
"We're here to support CCTV, bla bla bla. Please post this around 8:20."
It's obviously a ridiculous mistake made by this guy. He received the message from someone, who wanted him to post this message at a specific time range. But he forgot to delete the instruction after the real content.
I have posted the screen shots on my personal github homepage, so you can have a look at there.
Many famous news media in China has reported this event. The news media including NetEase, Sina, Yahoo! China. These companies are all convincing news media in China.
Besides that, like I said last week, I think people who suddenly changed their interests and supporting something they never talked about, is going to be considered as a hype situation. In this case, this guy is an actor and he only posts words relevant to movies, music, and his own CDs. So I think it's definitely a hype.
