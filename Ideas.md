1. I'm interested in the machine learning theory, such as the application made by Microsoft called Adam, or Google Brain. I know it may be hard to accomplish the research in 1 semester, but I still have great passion on it...
2. I've taken the data mining course this semester, so perhaps keep doing the data mining research in the following semester will be a good choice. I read through your website and found that you are good at social media mining area. If possible, I'd like to follow your step and learn your best research direction!
3. Otherwise, I might try to do some applications or prototype of real products which could be relevant simple/small, but motivated myself when finishing something real at the end of the semester.
